# lager-lang

This repository contains my implementation of the lager-lang interpreter in
Haskell.

## Overview

lager-lang is a simple programming language created for the JPP (Languages and
Paradigms of Programming) course.

## Building and running

To build the project, simply type:
```bash
make
```
To run the interpreter on a file, type:
```bash
./interpreter <file>
```
To run the interpreter on stdin, type:
```bash
./interpreter
```
and enter the code, terminating with `ctrl` + `d`.

## Examples

More info about the language can be found in `docs/description.pdf` and
`examples` directory.
