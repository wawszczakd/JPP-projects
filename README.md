# JPP Projects

This repository contains my projects from the course "Programming Languages and
Paradigms".

## Overview

JPP stands for "JÄ™zyki i Paradygmaty Programowania" in Polish, which translates
to "Programming Languages and Paradigms". This repository includes my projects
from this course. The first two projects are implemented in Haskell, and the
last project is implemented in Prolog.

## Project Descriptions

Short descriptions of the projects are listed below:

1. **Sets and Graphs**: The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of
Haskell. The goal was to implement modules `Set` and `Graph` along with basic
operations on them.

2. **Interpreter**: This project involved creating an interpreter for a custom
programming language (*lager-lang* in my case). The interpreter was written in
Haskell, with the help of `alex` and `happy`. More details about the interpreter
and the language, such as examples of usage and grammar, can be found in the
respective directory.

3. **Safety Checker**: Simple sequential programs were the subject of this
project. The aim was to analyze whether two processes can enter the critical
section at the same time.

Detailed solutions can be found in the respective directories.
